    "## A conceptual explanation of differentials\n",
    "\n",
    "To move on from derivatives and start considering integrals we'll begin by introducing the term \"differential\". Now, trying to define exactly what a \"differential\" is can be fraught with danger ([see the first few paragraphs of this blogpost](http://math.blogoverflow.com/2014/11/03/more-than-infinitesimal-what-is-dx/)). [Some have argued](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1358957) that it's less important to understand rigorously what a differential *is* as long as you know how to use them, etc. And they could well be right but I felt a little uncomfortable trying to follow some of the material without having a vague understanding of the concept. So (after a little bit of reading around) here's my attempt at explaining \"just enough\" of the concept...\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the notation of a differential, e.g., $dx$, comes from [Leibniz's notation for the derivative](../differentiation/0b.%20A%20bit%20about%20notation.ipynb#Leibniz's-notation):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dy}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The original intention was that this represented a ratio of infinitesimal values. The \"infinitesimal change in $y$ produced by an infinitesmal change in $x$\" divided by the \"infinitesmal change in $x$\". But this lead to a lot of problems (like the ones hinted to in that blog post linked to above - see also [this stackexchange answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/21209) for more about the problems of treating this as a ratio of infinitesimal values).\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why (as [explained right at the start of these notes](../differentiation/1.%20Definition%20of%20Derivative.ipynb)) the derivative is now defined in terms of a limit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim\\limits_{\\Delta x\\to 0} \\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ doesn't actually represent a quotient but a single limit. So what do the differentials, $dx$ and $dy$, mean when they appear on their own. The concept I'm going with for now is that they represent changes in $x$ and $y$ along the tangent line to the curve at the point in question, rather than along the curve itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$dy=f'(x)dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "And for small values they give a reasonable approximation to the curve itself - which brings us back to linear approximation...\n",
