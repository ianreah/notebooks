    "## What's the difference between the mean value theorem and linear approximation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look closely at the differences between this and the re-arrangement of the mean value theorem. There are two differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The second term in the mean value theorem uses the derivative at some point $c$ rather than at the point $a$. Now, we don't know where point $c$ is, other than it exists somewhere between $b$ and $a$, but...\n",
    "2. ...with the above change the approximation becomes an equality!\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear approximation formula is based on the assumption that the slope between $a$ and $b$ is *approximately* equal to the slope of the function at $a$, i.e., $f'(a)$...\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(b)\\approx f(a)+f'(a)(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(b)-f(a) \\approx f'(a)(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\approx f'(a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "...whereas, the mean value theorem tells us that the slope between $a$ and $b$ is *exactly* equal to the slope of the function at some (unknown) point $c$, i.e., $f'(c)$ where $a \\lt c \\lt b$...\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(b)=f(a)+f'(c)(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=f'(c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "And, if the slope between $a$ and $b$ is a value of the derivative of the function between $a$ and $b$ then it must be between the maximum and minimum values of the derivative of the function between $a$ and $b$...\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min\\limits_{a \\le x \\le b} f'(x) \\le f'(c) \\le \\max\\limits_{a \\le x \\le b} f'(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This assures us that the linear approximation gives a reasonable approximation when $a$ and $b$ are close.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The mean value theorem and approximation error\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to look at this is to say that the difference between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ is given by the last term in the linear approximation but using the derivative at some point $c$ rather than $a$...\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(b)-f(a)=f'(c)(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of $f(a)$ as a $0^{th}$ degree approximation of $f(b)$. So we're actually saying that the difference between the $0^{th}$ degree approximation and the actual value of $f(b)$ (i.e., the error of the approximation) is given by the last term in the $1^{st}$ degree approximation but using the derivative at some point $c$ instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this can be generalised to *higher degree* approximations. I don't know how to prove it just yet, but extending this to linear approximation, it's error would be given by the term we'd add for a *quadratic approximation* but using the second deriviative at some (unknown) point $c$...\n",

    "$\\frac{f''(c)}{2}(b-a)^2$\n",

    "![](img\\linear-approximation-error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We didn't actually use the name previously, but the general formula we derived for an $n^{th}$ degree approximation is called the [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series):\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)\\approx f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+\\frac{f''(x_0)}{2}(x-x_0)^2+...+\\frac{f^{(n-1)}(x_0)}{(n-1)!}(x-x_0)^{n-1}+\\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, the error of an $n^{th}$ degree approximation is based on the $(n+1)^{th}$ term in the Taylor series...\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We might not know how to prove that but we can test it out with a simple example. Consider a cubic polynomial...\n",
    "\n",

    "...and a quadratic approximation of $f(3)$ at $x_0=1$:\n",

    "$f(3)\\approx 4+5(3-1)+\\frac{6}{2}(3-1)^2\\approx 4+10+12\\approx 26$\n",

    "Now, it's true that we don't know what $c$ is but when we differentiate again to get $f^{(3)}$ we realise it's constant so it doesn't matter that we don't know $c$ (in this example)...\n",

    "$f^{(3)}(x)=6$\n",
