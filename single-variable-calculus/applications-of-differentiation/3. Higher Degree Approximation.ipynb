    "We've seen that the formula for the linear approximation of a function, $f(x)$, close to some value, $x_0$, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)\\approx f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a straight line passing through the point $(x_0,f(x_0))$, with the same gradient as $f(x)$ at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also seen that quadratic approximation adds an extra term to give a more accurate (but also slightly more complex) approximation:\n",

The rate of change of the gradient at any point is given by the second derivative.\n",

    "\n",
    "...so that it'll pass through the same value as the original function at $x_0$, and have the same first, second and third derivatives as the original function at that point. (We'll really just be adding an extra $x^3$ term to the quadratic approximation but let's work through the calculation of all coefficients for practice!)\n",
