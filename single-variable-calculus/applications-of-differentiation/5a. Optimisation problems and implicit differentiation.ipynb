    "Using implicit differentiation can often be a quicker/easier way to solve optimisation problems, and (as the example below will show) can get you straight to a \"nicer\" form of the answer. The disadvantage is that it only gets you the critical points so if you need to check the end behaviour &/or disconinuities it might not save you that much time. In some cases though you don't need to check the end behaviour (e.g., it's obvious that the ends are not the minimum/maximum points)."
