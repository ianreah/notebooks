So the greatest area enclosed is $\\frac{1}{16}$ which occurs when there is only one square. This might be considered \"cheating\" giving the question asked what's the greatest area when the wire is cut into 2. We should really say that $\\frac{1}{16}$ is the limit when $x \\to 0$ or $x \\to 1$ (i.e., when the wire is cut close to either end)."
